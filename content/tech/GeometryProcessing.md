Assignment of CSCI 599: Geometry Processing from USC

Geometry processing is an essential part of various DCC software and game engines. 

This repository digs into the underlying mathematical principles of each geometry processing algorithm, implementing thes algorithms from scratch, and providing a deep understanding of their mechanics.

Geometry processing algorithm includes:

- Point cloud ***Reconstruction*** to Mesh
- Mesh ***Registration***
- Triangle Mesh ***Subdivision***
- Triangle Mesh ***Decimation***
- Noisy Mesh ***Smoothing***

**Reconstruction**
