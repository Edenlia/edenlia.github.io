## Welcome to my website!

I'm currently pursuing the Master Degree in Computer Science (Game Development) in **University of Southern California**. 

I'm passionate about everything related to **GAMES**, especially the intersection of art and technology. Iâ€™m fascinated by the idea of blending creativity with technical expertise to create immersive gaming experiences.

I'm currently  working hard to become an excellent game developer and am thrilled to be learning design and art-related skills alongside my development knowledge, with the hope of becoming a multi-skilled professional in the future.
